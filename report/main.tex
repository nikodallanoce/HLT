\begin{abstract}
The report starts with a long, but needed introduction to the main concepts that we've seen during the course of our work and it shows what was our purpose and how we reached it. Then it shows the results obtained by the models we tried giving at the same time the reasons of their performances. The report concludes with our final considerations on what and how we could have done more.
